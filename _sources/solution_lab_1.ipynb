Therefore the lower the approximated energy is the better. So in order from best to worst: 6-311g, aug-cc-pvdz, cc-pvdz, 6-31+g, 6-31g, sto-3g.\n",

Adding one more (6-31G) and two more (6-311G) basis functions per occupied valence orbital improves the results (yeilds lower energies). 6-31+g adds a diffuse function to 6-31g, this improves the result somewhat, but not as much as going to 6-311g. cc-pVDZ is double-zeta like 6-31G, but it has an added polarization function,  which impoove the results compared to 6-31G. aug-cc-pVDZ adds a diffuse term to cc-pVDZ, and thus has both polarization and diffuse functions. This results in even lower energy than cc-pVDZ. Triple-zeta (6-311G) still yeilds the lowest energy out of all basis sets, probably since we have an isolated ground state atom and polarization and diffuse functions are mostly important for bonding and excited state calculations."
